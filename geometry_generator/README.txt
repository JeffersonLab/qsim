The following is a descriptions of the geometry generator package

1) geometry_generator
	This directory contains code that builds new mirror and stack geometry and automatically replaces the appropriate source file (qsim/qsim-master/src/qsimDetectorConstruction.cpp). Of most importance are mirrorDimensions* and translateSHMX.pl. mirrorDimensions* takes input from the user about the stack to be simulated. It then uses this to calculate the size and placement of the quartz and tungsten pieces. Next it calculates the light guide geometry and placement. From here, this data is sent to a text file called mirrorTranslations.txt. The perl script is then called. It takes the text file and replaces the appropriate lines in qsimDetectorConstruction.cc and saves to a new file (qsimDetectorConstructionNew.cc). The user is then prompted if they want to replace the source file in qsim with this new construction file. NOTE: mirrorDimensions.cpp is the vanilla program for static tungsten thickness. mirrorDimensionsAdvanced.cpp allows for varying tungsten thickness and will soon be modified for non-uniform quartz and W thicknesses.
